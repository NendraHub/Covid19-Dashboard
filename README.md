## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing the distribution of COVID-19 data in Indonesia. The dataset used for this analysis, titled "COVID-19 Indonesia Dataset," was sourced from Kaggle and published by Hendratno in 2023. The analysis provides six key insights:
- Total number of deaths
- Total number of cases
- New cases
- Map distribution of new cases and total deaths
- Most affected provinces
- Comparison of death and recovery rates across the region

## Dataset Overview
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hendratno/covid19-indonesia) contains 3,493 rows with 38 columns, but the ones I used are: 
- Date: Daily record of cases and deaths.
- Province: Regional breakdown of data.
- New Cases: Daily number of confirmed cases.
- Total Cases: Cumulative count of confirmed cases.
- New Deaths: Daily number of reported deaths.
- Total Deaths: Cumulative count of deaths.
- Recoveries: Total number of recovered cases.
